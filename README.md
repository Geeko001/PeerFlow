# 🔒 PeerFlow  
**A 100% Private, Peer-to-Peer Video Calling Website**  
*No servers. No logs. No storage. No money. Full transparency.*

## 🧠 What is PeerFlow?

PeerFlow is a **fully peer-to-peer video calling site** built with one core idea:

> **If I don’t have servers, your data has nowhere to be stored.**

All calls happen **directly between users** using peer-to-peer connections.  
No videos are recorded.  
No calls are logged.  
No messages are saved.  

Not because of policy — but because **it’s technically impossible here**.

## 🔐 Privacy (The Honest Version)

PeerFlow does **not** collect, store, or process any user data.

- ❌ No databases  
- ❌ No call recordings  
- ❌ No chat history  
- ❌ No user accounts  
- ❌ No analytics  
- ❌ No cookies for tracking  

If something goes wrong, there’s nothing to leak — because nothing exists.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Simple)

- Users connect **browser-to-browser**
- Video & audio flow **peer-to-peer**
- Any backend logic (if present) is only for **temporary signaling**
- Once connected, **no server stays in the loop**

Close the tab → call is gone forever.

## 🧪 What PeerFlow Is NOT

Let’s keep it real:

- ❌ Not a commercial product  
- ❌ Not enterprise-ready  
- ❌ Not scalable to huge traffic  
- ❌ Not storing anything on purpose  

If the backend breaks, the call breaks.  
That’s not a bug — that’s the cost of privacy and being broke.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- NAT / firewall issues may occur  
- No recovery if connection drops  
- Backend signaling must be working for peers to connect  
- If the backend is messed up, the app won’t work (fair warning)

## 🧠 Final Note

> No memory. No records.  
> Just a call — then silence.
